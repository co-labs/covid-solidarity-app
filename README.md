# quarantine
In quarantine for #covid19? Share what you need and find rebels that can help you.

We are rebelling against extinction and we won't leave anyone behind.
If you are in quarantine for the coronavirus and you need anything, use this app to let the community know.

If you are in good health and you can help, check out the app to find people near you that need your help. It will mean the world to them.

Stay safe.

## How it works

### If you are in quarantine
- Go to https://quarantine.help
- Share what you need (groceries, bread, medicines, anything)
- Enter your address to pin point where you are on the map
- Enter your name, email and phone number. Those won't be shared publicly (see below)

### If you are here to help someone in quarantine
- Go to https://quarantine.help
- See around you what people need
- Once you find someone that you can help, click on "offer my help"
- Enter your name and some info about you, including a way to contact you
- We will send an email to the person who was asking for help with your contact info
